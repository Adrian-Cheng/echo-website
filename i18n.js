        "letter.importance": "In today's world, the importance of English is self-evident. It's like a key that opens doors to a broader world. Through English, we can access international news, enjoy original films and shows, learn cutting-edge global knowledge, and communicate with people from different cultural backgrounds. Life is short, and we hope that by mastering English, we can broaden our horizons and embrace more possibilities.",
        "letter.mission": "The original intention of developing ECHO is to provide everyone with a convenient and efficient oral practice tool. Users can import their favorite videos, audio, or movies into the App for sentence-by-sentence shadowing, recording, AI scoring, word lookup, and personal vocabulary building. All features support fully offline use—practice anytime without internet.",
        "letter.status": "Currently, the Android version is available for download, and the iOS version is complete but not yet officially listed on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The reason is that, as an individual developer, paying for developer account fees, app review costs, and server maintenance presents some temporary difficulties.",
        "letter.pro": "Therefore, in the early stages of the project, we introduced the PRO subscription mechanism. This is not simply about charging money, but rather we hope that through everyone's collective support (similar to crowdfunding), we can help the project get listed as soon as possible, so that more users can conveniently access and use this application.",
        "letter.promise": "I solemnly promise: Once the app is officially listed, the user base expands, and operating costs are covered, I will cancel the subscription mechanism and make ECHO completely free for all users. My development goal has always been to help everyone improve their English speaking ability, not commercial profit.",
        "letter.support": "If you recognize the value of this application and are willing to support it, you're welcome to upgrade to PRO membership. Every bit of your support will help the project better serve more learners.",
        "letter.thanks": "Thank you for your understanding and trust. Let's work together to connect with a broader world through English.",
